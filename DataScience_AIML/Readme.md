## Where do we require Data Science

 <h3><em>Machine Learning</em></h3>

1. Fraud Detection: Gather Data , Amount, date,address,Location, Label :  valid or fraud.
2. This is training Data : Probability of new transaction to be fraud.   
2. Problem Statement: Get this clear.
3. Example data: Data to train with labels.
4. Cars to predict human: convert image to matrix and process data.
5. Apple watch: HEART RATE , MOTION SENSORS,ETC......
6. Deep Learning: Multiple Layers of algorithm called as neurons works together to draw conclusion.
7. High Amount of Data than Machine Learning
